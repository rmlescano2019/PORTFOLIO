# PORTFOLIO
This repository contains a collection of all my past projects. Each project may contain its own folder with a description of its purpose, features, and technologies used.
I've included the source code, documentation, and any additional resources that were used in each project. Feel free to explore the repository and see how I've grown as a
developer over time.
